### How to Run:
- start by cloning the project
- If you dont have node installed, install it through https://nodejs.org/fr
- I suppose you have python on your machine if not then you can get the latest version https://www.python.org/downloads/
- In the server folder run ```pip install -r requirements``` & In the client folder run ```npm install```
- Launch the backend by cd to server directory and running ```uvicorn --reload app.main:app```
- Launch the front by cd to client directory and running ```npm run dev```
- You can have multiple tabs so you can simulate a "real" world usage.
